## 24.4.0

### New

* Initial commit. [Thomas Merkel]

  Install and configure pretix. Because not all pretix requirements are
  available in pkgsrc a post script install everything needed. This is an
  initial workaround to provide the image.

  Hopefully we will have pretix in pkgsrc in the future.
